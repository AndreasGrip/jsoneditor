This is a simple JSON editor to simplify editing of JSON from webpages.
50lines of vanilla javascript plus a whooping 14lines of css for the full example.
After a div with the class "jsonEditor" is updated with correct JSON.
A function in this example called runOnSuccessfulJSON, again look at the code.
Check the code of this page example function runOnSuccessfulJSON to understand it better.
And open the console to se what the function is doing.
